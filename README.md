This package is the core of the [web-glasses](https://github.com/csskevin/web-glasses) project. It includes the fundamentals of the concept. Currently there are seven primary classes.
- Apps
- Driver
- Files
- Permission
- Services
- Verification
- Workfolder

The Driver class is the most important class for plugin developers. With this class you can extend the web-glasses project with your own services.
